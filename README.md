## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This was my first hands-on data analytics project using Python — and it showed me how powerful and readable pandas can be for business questions. Recreating SQL logic with Python gave me a deeper understanding of both tools, and visualizing the results made the insights feel even more real.

I look forward to building more Python + data projects as I continue growing in this journey!
